## Week 1

The week started with the creation of the groups and what would be doing each of them.
Each group would do a part of the design of the web page.

Week objective: Create a template of the web page on figma.

## Week 2

Once the template was completed, we have to make it real. 
To do that we had to start with the html file.

Week objective: Make the complete html file with all the elements of the figma design.

## Week 3

Now, we have done the html file (but it's not as pretty as in figma).
We have to style it with css.

Week objective: Leave the page pretty as the figma template with a css file.

## Week 4

Once we saw flexbox, we had to aplied that knowledge to the css.

Week objetive: Make the page mobile first and fully responsive with flexboxes.
